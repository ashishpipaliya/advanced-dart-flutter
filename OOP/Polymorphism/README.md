# Polymorphism

## 📌 What is it?

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated through the same interface, typically a base class or interface.

## ⚡ Example

Different shapes implement a common `area()` method; code works with the `Shape` type.

## Two types of polymorphism
- Compile-time Polymorphism (static polymorphism, method overloading) : Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, resolved at compile time.
- Run-time Polymorphism (dynamic polymorphism, method overriding) : A subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in a parent class or interface, resolved at runtime.

## 🚀 Run the example

```bash
cd "OOP/Polymorphism"
dart main.dart
```
