# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

A concise overview of OOP fundamentals with links to short, runnable examples in this repository. Each subfolder contains a focused README and a `main.dart` demonstration.

Core Concepts

- [Classes & Objects](OOP/Classes%20%26%20Objects) — A class is a blueprint and an object is its concrete instance that holds state and behavior.
- [Inheritance](OOP/Inheritance) — Inheritance lets a class reuse and extend behavior from another class.
- [Polymorphism](OOP/Polymorphism) — Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be used interchangeably through a shared interface.
- [Encapsulation](OOP/Encapsulation) — Encapsulation hides internal state behind a controlled interface to protect invariants and manage access.
- [Abstraction](OOP/Abstraction) — Abstraction exposes essential operations while hiding implementation details behind a simplified interface.
- [Interfaces](OOP/Interfaces) — Interfaces define a contract of members that implementing classes must fulfill without specifying implementation.
- [Mixin](OOP/Mixin) — A mixin allows a class to reuse behavior from multiple sources without inheriting from them

How to use these examples

1. Open the topic folder, e.g. `OOP/Classes & Objects`
2. Run the example:

```bash
cd "OOP/Classes & Objects"
dart run main.dart
```

Why these topics matter

- They form the foundation for designing maintainable, extensible systems.
- Each concept addresses a common design question (how to model data, reuse behavior, hide details, or define contracts).

Suggested learning flow

1. Start with `Classes & Objects` to understand instances and state
2. Learn `Inheritance` and `Polymorphism` for reuse and flexible APIs
3. Study `Encapsulation` and `Abstraction` to protect and simplify interfaces
4. Finish with `Interfaces` to decouple code and enable testability
5. Look into what `Mixin` is

Key takeaway

Master these fundamentals to design clearer APIs and make patterns and architectures easier to understand and apply.
