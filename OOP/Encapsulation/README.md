# Encapsulation

## 📌 What is it?

Encapsulation hides internal state and exposes behavior through methods, protecting invariants and controlling access.

## ⚡ Example

A `BankAccount` exposes `deposit` and `withdraw` while keeping `_balance` private.

## 🚀 Run the example

```bash
cd "OOP/Encapsulation"
dart main.dart
```
