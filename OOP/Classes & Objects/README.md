# Classes & Objects

## 📌 What is it?

Classes are blueprints for objects. An object is an instance of a class that holds state (fields) and behavior (methods).

## 🤔 When to use

- Model real-world concepts (User, Product, Vehicle)
- Group related data and behavior together

## ⚡ Example

A simple `Person` class with properties and methods. See `main.dart` for a runnable example.

## 🚀 Run the example

```bash
cd "OOP/Classes & Objects"
dart main.dart
```

## 📝 Key Takeaway

Classes encapsulate data + behavior; objects are instances created from classes.
