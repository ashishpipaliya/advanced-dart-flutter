# Inheritance

## 📌 What is it?

Inheritance lets a class (subclass) reuse properties and behavior from another class (superclass), enabling code reuse and specialization.

## ⚡ Example

`Animal` is a base class; `Dog` extends `Animal` and adds behavior.

## 🚀 Run the example

```bash
cd "OOP/Inheritance"
dart main.dart
```
