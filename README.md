## ✅ Implemented Concepts

### SOLID Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Single Responsibility](SOLID%20principles/Single%20Responsibility/README.md) | One reason to change |
| [Open/Closed](SOLID%20principles/Open%20Closed/README.md) | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| [Liskov Substitution](SOLID%20principles/Liskov%20Substitution/README.md) | Subtypes must be substitutable for base types |
| [Interface Segregation](SOLID%20principles/Interface%20Segregation/README.md) | Clients should not depend on unused interfaces |
| [Dependency Inversion](SOLID%20principles/Dependency%20Inversion/README.md) | Depend on abstractions, not implementations |

### Design Patterns

| Pattern | Category |
|---------|----------|
| [Singleton](Design%20patterns/Singleton/README.md) | Creational |
