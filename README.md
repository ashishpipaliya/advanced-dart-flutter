## ✅ Implemented Concepts

### SOLID Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Single Responsibility](SOLID%20principles/Single%20Responsibility/README.md) | One reason to change |
| [Open/Closed](SOLID%20principles/Open%20Closed/README.md) | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| [Liskov Substitution](SOLID%20principles/Liskov%20Substitution/README.md) | Subtypes must be substitutable for base types |
| [Interface Segregation](SOLID%20principles/Interface%20Segregation/README.md) | Clients should not depend on unused interfaces |
| [Dependency Inversion](SOLID%20principles/Dependency%20Inversion/README.md) | Depend on abstractions, not implementations |

### Design Patterns

| Pattern | Category |
|---------|----------|
| [Singleton](Design%20patterns/Singleton) | Creational |
| [Factory Method](Design%20patterns/Factory%20Method) | Creational |
| [Builder](Design%20patterns/Builder) | Creational |
| [Adapter](Design%20patterns/Adapter) | Structural |
| [Strategy](Design%20patterns/Strategy) | Behavioral |
| [Observer](Design%20patterns/Observer) | Behavioral |
| [State](Design%20patterns/State) | Behavioral |

### OOP Fundamentals

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Classes & Objects](OOP/Classes%20%26%20Objects) | Blueprints and instances (examples) |
| [Inheritance](OOP/Inheritance) | Reuse and specialize behavior |
| [Polymorphism](OOP/Polymorphism) | Multiple types, same interface |
| [Encapsulation](OOP/Encapsulation) | Hide state, expose behavior |
| [Abstraction](OOP/Abstraction) | Simplified interface to complexity |
| [Interfaces](OOP/Interfaces) | Contracts implemented by classes |
| [Mixin](OOP/Mixin) | Reusability |

### Architectural Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [MVVM](Architectural%20patterns) | Model-View-ViewModel architecture |
| [Clean Architecture](Architectural%20patterns) | Layered architecture for scalability |
